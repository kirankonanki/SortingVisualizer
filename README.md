# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Java-based application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. 
This project aims to help users understand the mechanics of sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations.

## Features
- Visual representation of sorting algorithms in action.
- Supports multiple sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Adjustable speed for visualizations.
- User-friendly interface with controls to start, pause, and reset the sorting process.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms.
